# Ghana-Regional-Hackathon for Team 1
##Challenge: 
Develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies data captured by CubeSats. The goal is to prioritize which images are most valuable for transmission back to Earth, given the limited onboard resources and slow data downlink speeds. Your task is to create a lightweight model that improves the efficiency and/or classification accuracy of the existing solution in this paper
